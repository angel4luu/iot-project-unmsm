# Article (IEEE)

LaTeX sources for the paper *Design, Implementation, and Experimental Evaluation
of an IoT-Based System for Real-Time Electrical Energy Consumption Monitoring and
Analysis*. The requirements are in [SPEC.md](SPEC.md). Overall project tracking is
in the [root README](../README.md#6-article-track).

## Build

Requires TeX Live with `IEEEtran`, `latexmk`, and `bibtex`.

```sh
make            # build/main.pdf
make watch      # rebuild on save
make clean      # remove aux files, keep PDF
make distclean  # remove build/
```

The bibliography is active (BibTeX with `IEEEtran.bst`). Every entry is DOI-verified,
or for official statistics checked at the source.

Conventions:
- The paper is written in **Spanish** (`babel` spanish). Code comments and repo docs stay in English.
- The specs in `../specs/` are the source of truth. `SPEC.md` is guidance only, and every deviation is recorded under Decisions below.
- One sentence per line in the `.tex` files, so diffs stay readable.
- Labels use `sec:`, `fig:`, `tab:`, and `eq:` prefixes.
- Numbers in results tables come from scripts under `../experiments/evaluation/`
  and are never typed by hand. Each table states the evidence artifact it comes from.
- Figures are vector (PDF) wherever possible, and each one has its source next to it.

## Decisions

| # | Decision | Date |
|---|---|---|
| AD-1 | Written in LaTeX with `IEEEtran` in conference mode, built with latexmk/BibTeX | 2026-10-28 |
| AD-2 | Language: Spanish, with a Spanish title (the proposal's translation) | 2026-10-28 |
| AD-3 | Hardware follows `plan.md`/`research.md` R-001 (ESP32 + ADS131M02 + SCT-013-020 + isolated voltage sensing), not the proposal's PZEM-004T. The proposal allows "u otro módulo adecuado" | 2026-10-28 |
| AD-4 | Measured quantities follow the spec: V_RMS, I_RMS, active power, active energy. P is defined as the mean of v·i (FR-003), not V·I·PF. Power factor and frequency get no accuracy claim; they appear only as a limitation and future work. The accuracy table has no PF row | 2026-10-28 |
| AD-5 | "Analysis" means what the spec delivers: hourly/daily/weekly aggregation, peak-period identification (SC-005), and threshold alerts with confirmation that reject startup surges (FR-011, SC-004). Statistical anomaly detection and forecasting are future work (plan › Future Dataset). "Detection accuracy" is measured as correct firing/non-firing of threshold alerts under scripted loads | 2026-10-28 |
| AD-6 | Venue not chosen. Keep the IEEE conference defaults (Letter, ~6 pages) and recheck when one is chosen | 2026-10-28 (deferred) |
| AD-7 | Numbers use a decimal comma (`siunitx` `output-decimal-marker={,}`), following the Spanish/INEI convention. Write numbers with `\SI{}`/`\num{}` | 2026-10-28 |
| AD-8 | Prior-work limitations are narrowed to what the evidence supports (`research/limitations-evidence.md`): heterogeneous validation, rarely measured latency, no controlled outage-recovery evaluation, and analytics evaluated apart from the hardware. The proposal's claims of "no power-factor analysis" and "always depends on connectivity" are contradicted by the literature and are not used | 2026-10-28 |
| AD-9 | Figures are TikZ sources in `figures/`, `\input` into the sections, single-column, black-and-white friendly. Fig. 2 is a single-line wiring diagram without pin numbers until the PCB review; add a labelled photo once the prototype is built | 2026-11-11 |
